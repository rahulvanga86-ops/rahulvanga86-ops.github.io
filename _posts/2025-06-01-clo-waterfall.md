## Introduction

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) are often described as complex structured products. In reality, the core idea is straightforward: cash flows generated by a pool of leveraged loans are distributed to different investors in a predefined priority order.

This post walks through a simplified CLO waterfall to explain how interest and principal are allocated across tranches and why this structure matters for risk and return.

## CLO Capital Structure (Simplified)

A typical CLO is funded through multiple tranches with different risk profiles:

| Tranche | Risk Level | Expected Return |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Senior Notes (AAA/AA) | Lowest | Lowest |
| Mezzanine Notes (A/BBB/BB) | Medium | Medium |
| Equity | Highest | Highest |

## Sources of Cash Flow

CLO cash flows primarily come from:
- Interest payments on underlying leveraged loans  
- Principal repayments from amortization, prepayments, or loan sales  

---

## Interest Waterfall (Conceptual)

On each payment date, interest cash flows are distributed in the following order:

1. Senior note interest  
2. Mezzanine note interest  
3. Subordinated note interest (if applicable)  
4. Equity distributions (residual)  

---

## Principal Waterfall (Conceptual)

Principal proceeds are generally applied to:
1. Maintain or improve senior note coverage  
2. Repay notes in order of seniority  
3. Residual amounts flow to equity  

---

## Role of Coverage Tests (OC / IC)

Overcollateralization (OC) and Interest Coverage (IC) tests act as early warning mechanisms.

If a test fails, cash that would otherwise flow to equity or junior tranches is redirected to repay senior notes.

## Closing Thoughts

CLOs are structured to prioritize capital preservation for senior investors while concentrating risk and return in junior tranches.

Understanding the waterfall is essential to understanding CLO risk.
