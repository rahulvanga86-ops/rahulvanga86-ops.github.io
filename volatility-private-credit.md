title: "Why Volatility Is a Poor Risk Measure for Private Credit"
---

## Introduction

Volatility is a widely used risk metric in public markets. It measures how frequently and how sharply prices move over time and works reasonably well for liquid, continuously traded assets such as equities and bonds.

However, applying volatility-based risk measures to private credit can be misleading. The nature of private credit instruments makes price-based volatility a weak proxy for actual risk.

## Why Volatility Works in Public Markets

In public markets:
- Assets are traded frequently
- Prices update continuously
- Market participants can observe risk through price movements

Higher volatility typically reflects:
- Uncertainty in future cash flows
- Changes in interest rates or fundamentals
- Shifts in investor sentiment

In this context, volatility is informative.

## Why Volatility Fails in Private Credit

Private credit assets:
- Do not trade frequently
- Are typically held at par unless impaired
- Are valued using models or periodic assessments rather than market prices

As a result:
- Reported volatility is artificially low
- Lack of price movement does not imply low risk
- Risk accumulates silently and materializes only when credit events occur

This makes volatility an unreliable standalone risk measure for private credit portfolios.

## Risks That Actually Matter in Private Credit

### Defaults

The primary risk in private credit is borrower default. Losses tend to be discrete rather than continuous and are not captured by gradual price movements.

---

### Recoveries

Loss severity depends heavily on recovery rates:
- Quality of collateral
- Capital structure position
- Legal and restructuring outcomes

Two loans with identical default probabilities can have very different loss outcomes.

---

### Concentration

Private credit portfolios are often concentrated by:
- Borrower
- Industry
- Sponsor

A small number of defaults can have an outsized impact on portfolio performance.

---

### Liquidity

Private credit is inherently illiquid:
- Positions cannot be exited quickly
- Risk cannot be actively traded away
- Valuation may lag underlying deterioration

Liquidity risk becomes most visible during stress periods.

## How Investors Actually Think About Risk

Experienced private credit investors focus less on price volatility and more on:
- Downside scenarios
- Default and recovery assumptions
- Portfolio concentration limits
- Structural protections and covenants

Risk management in private credit is driven by cash flows and loss outcomes, not short-term price fluctuations.

## Closing Thoughts

Volatility is a useful metric in liquid markets but is insufficient for assessing risk in private credit.

Understanding private credit risk requires focusing on loss mechanics, structural protections, and portfolio construction rather than relying on price-based measures alone.
