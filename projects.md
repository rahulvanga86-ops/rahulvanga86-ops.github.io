# Simple Loan Portfolio Analysis (Python)

This project uses a simplified loan dataset to explore basic portfolio-level metrics such as exposure, weighted average margin, and loss sensitivity.

The objective is conceptual understanding of credit portfolios rather than production-level financial modeling.
