title: "How a CLO Waterfall Actually Works: A Simplified Walkthrough"
---

## Introduction

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) are often described as complex structured products. In reality, the core idea is straightforward: cash flows generated by a pool of leveraged loans are distributed to different investors in a predefined priority order.

This post walks through a simplified CLO waterfall to explain how interest and principal are allocated across tranches and why this structure matters for risk and return.

## CLO Capital Structure (Simplified)

A typical CLO is funded through multiple tranches with different risk profiles:

| Tranche | Risk Level | Expected Return |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Senior Notes (AAA/AA) | Lowest | Lowest |
| Mezzanine Notes (A/BBB/BB) | Medium | Medium |
| Equity | Highest | Highest |

Each tranche has a defined priority in receiving cash flows from the underlying loan portfolio.

## Sources of Cash Flow

CLO cash flows primarily come from:
- Interest payments on underlying leveraged loans
- Principal repayments from amortization, prepayments, or loan sales

These cash flows are collected at the CLO level and distributed according to the waterfall.

---

## Interest Waterfall (Conceptual)

On each payment date, interest cash flows are distributed in the following order:

1. Senior note interest
2. Mezzanine note interest
3. Subordinated note interest (if applicable)
4. Equity distributions (residual)

If available cash is insufficient at any level, lower-priority tranches receive reduced or zero payments.

---

## Principal Waterfall (Conceptual)

Principal proceeds are generally applied to:
1. Maintain or improve senior note coverage
2. Repay notes in order of seniority
3. Residual amounts flow to equity

The exact rules vary by deal, but senior protection is always the priority.

---

## Role of Coverage Tests (OC / IC)

Overcollateralization (OC) and Interest Coverage (IC) tests act as early warning mechanisms.

If a test fails:
- Cash that would otherwise flow to equity or junior tranches is redirected to repay senior notes
- This protects senior investors at the expense of equity returns

These tests are central to CLO risk management.

---

## Why Equity Returns Are Asymmetric

CLO equity absorbs:
- All downside from loan defaults and recoveries
- All upside once senior obligations are met

This results in:
- Limited downside protection
- Potentially high upside in stable credit environments

Understanding the waterfall explains why CLO equity behaves differently from traditional fixed income.

## Closing Thoughts

CLOs are structured to prioritize capital preservation for senior investors while concentrating risk and return in junior tranches.

The mechanics are not complex, but they are precise. Understanding the waterfall is essential before forming any view on CLO risk or performance.
