# About

I work in structured credit and portfolio services, supporting private debt and CLO-style mandates for institutional asset managers.

My role focuses on loan lifecycle mechanics, cashflow allocation, servicer data validation, and portfolio-level controls used in performance and compliance reporting.

This site documents my efforts to deepen understanding of structured credit, private debt, and alternative investment risk through written explainers and small applied analytics projects. The objective is clarity and practical understanding rather than opinion or market forecasting.
