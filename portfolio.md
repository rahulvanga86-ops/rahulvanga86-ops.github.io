# Projects

Here are applied analytics projects where I use Python to model credit risk and analyze loan portfolios.

---

### 1. Loan Portfolio Analysis (Python)
**Goal:** Automate the reporting of key risk metrics for a hypothetical private credit loan tape.

**What I Did:**
* Ingested raw loan tape data (Excel/CSV) using **Python (Pandas)**.
* Calculated portfolio-level metrics: **Weighted Average Spread (WAS)**, **Weighted Average Life (WAL)**, and diversity scores.
* Created an automated script to flag loans exceeding concentration limits (e.g., >5% industry exposure).
* Visualized exposure by Industry and Rating using Matplotlib.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

### 2. CLO Cash Flow Waterfall (Concept)
*Currently documenting my knowledge on CLO payment structures.*

**Goal:** Model the priority of payments (waterfall) during a hypothetical default scenario.
* Modeled the **Interest Coverage (IC)** and **Overcollateralization (OC)** tests.
* Simulated cash diversion mechanisms when tests fail.
